And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect--provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground.I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lion's share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because it's in our national security interests and also because it's the right thing to do.We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground.

And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. We've had 10 hearings on it. We've sent reams of information about what the operations are. I've had all the Members of Congress over to talk about it.

So if you're going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments, you've got to consult with Congress beforehand.And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate.

      "Interviewer:  How concerned are you about this lack of consensus?\n",
      "Raw question: Q. It's Aurelia End for AFP. I had a question on the climate crisis. You just mentioned the G-20. Just this week, the United States warned that if there is no phasing out of fossil fuels, it won't be possible to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. There was no agreement at the G-20 on fossil fuels. How concerned are you about this lack of consensus?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph R. Biden: It wasn't so much an agreement that we would try to meet the goals at the G-20. The United States is going to meet those goals, by the way. We're going to exceed those goals. A lot of other countries are as well.But we want to give those countries that don't have the economic wherewithal and did not cause the problem in the first placefor example, I met with Lula in Brazil.I started off way back in the eighties with a really fine Republican Senator named Dick Lugar. We said: Here's what we're going to do. If you owe us money, we're going to forgive your debt if you maintain your forest. Because they become carbon sinks. They're the things that take carbon out of the air.And so we're talking to what we should be goand the countries that cleared their land and put cattle on there and farming and did all the things thatand increased development, they, in fact, are the onesthe reasons whythe main reason why we've gotten as far down the road to disaster here as we have.And so it seemsand if we have the economic capacity, wethose nations should be getting together and providing help for the nations that don't have the wherewithal to do it, the economic wherewithal and the infrastructure wherewithal.And that's why, for example, I mentionedin the interest of time, I'll just mention Angola again. Angola has the capacity to generate megawatts of energy through solar energy. They don't have the economic means to do that. Isn't it in the interest of the whole world if they are, in fact, able to generate significant capacity to absorbto prevent carbon from being released in the air? I think that it is.So what we're trying to do is help those nations. Theand particularly in the Global South, where they're not as wealthy, where there are not as many opportunities to be able to deal with the things that they want to deal with.For exampleand I'll end with thisthere is more carbon absorbed from the atmosphere on a daily basisand I'll look to mymy friend, John Kerry, who'd forgotten more about this than most people knowcorrect me if I get this wrong, John, but I'm quite sure I'm rightand that is that there's more carbon observed [absorbed; White House correction] from the air into the Amazon region into the groundthe groundthan emitted in the entire United States on the same basis.Now, imagine if people go in and do what we did 150, 200, 250 years ago and cut down the forest and thestart farming in that area, no longer have that great carbon sink. Weyou know, it's goingit would be a gigantic problem.So we should be going to areas, whether it's in the Congo or other places, as the G-7 nations and as the wealthy G-20 nations, theand providing the kind of infrastructure they need to be able to benefit.And guess what? In addition to helping the environment overalland the only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 2010 years. We'rethat'd be real trouble. There's no way back from that.And so there's a lot we can do in the meantime. For example, that pipelinethat railroad we're talking about going across from the middlefrom India, throughout the Middle East, and toacross the Mediterranean and all through Europe, that's going to have a hydrogen pipeline there. This is going to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted in the air, but it costs a lot of money to put that down. And the world is going to say it's in our interestcollective interest to do it.So I have notI have not given up at all on the notion that we're going to be able to, you knowhow can I say it? I think we can triple the renewable capacity foras it relates to global warmingby the year 20302030.Countries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passedthe clean energy jobs, they're going to create manufacturing jobs.For example, as a consequence of what we've done, we have the mostwe have the mostwe have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the worldin the world. Now, we've got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world.And one of the reasons we're doing itwe changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economythat is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well.Well, the truth of the matter is, I've never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with mejust flat, straight-out academic economistsand that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up.When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well. But you're going to start paying your taxes if I have anything to do it. That's a different issue.But all kidding asideso there'swe haveI think the other thing that's dawning on peoplemany of you who are foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time. Did you ever think you'd be sitting at a G-20 conference where everyone was preoccupied with the notion of global warming? Not a joke. Did you ever think that?And there's amy brother loves havingthere's famous lines from movies that he always quotes. You know, it'sand one of them isthere's a movie about John Wayne. He's an Indian scout. And they're trying to get theI think it was the Apacheone of the great tribes of America back on the reservation.And he's standing with a Union soldierso he'sthey're all on theirand they're on their horses in their saddles. And there's three or four Indians in headdresses, and the Union soldiersand the Union soldiers are basically saying to the Indians: Come with me, we'll take care of you. We'lleverything will be good. And the Indian scoutthe Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, He's a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.Well, there's a lot of lying, dog-faced pony soldiers out there about global warming, but not anymore. All of a sudden, they're all realizing it's a problem. And there's nothing like seeing the light.Forand let's see. I'm just following my orders here.Staff, is there anybody I haven't spoken to?[] The President. No, I ain't calling on you. I'm calling onI said there were five questions. AnitaAnita from VOA. The President. Anita [Anita Powell, Voice of America] from VOA.\n",

And the world is going to say it's in our interestcollective interest to do it.So I have notI have not given up at all on the notion that we're going to be able to, you knowhow can I say it? I think we can triple the renewable capacity foras it relates to global warmingby the year 20302030.Countries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passedthe clean energy jobs, they're going to create manufacturing jobs.For example, as a consequence of what we've done, we have the mostwe have the mostwe have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the worldin the world. Now, we've got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world.And one of the reasons we're doing itwe changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economythat is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well.Well, the truth of the matter is, I've never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with mejust flat, straight-out academic economistsand that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up.When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well. But you're going to start paying your taxes if I have anything to do it. That's a different issue.But all kidding asideso there'swe haveI think the other thing that's dawning on peoplemany of you who are foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time. Did you ever think you'd be sitting at a G-20 conference where everyone was preoccupied with the notion of global warming? Not a joke. Did you ever think that?And there's amy brother loves havingthere's famous lines from movies that he always quotes. You know, it'sand one of them isthere's a movie about John Wayne. He's an Indian scout. And they're trying to get theI think it was the Apacheone of the great tribes of America back on the reservation.And he's standing with a Union soldierso he'sthey're all on theirand they're on their horses in their saddles. And there's three or four Indians in headdresses, and the Union soldiersand the Union soldiers are basically saying to the Indians: Come with me, we'll take care of you. We'lleverything will be good. And the Indian scoutthe Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, He's a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.Well, there's a lot of lying, dog-faced pony soldiers out there about global warming, but not anymore. All of a sudden, they're all realizing it's a problem. And there's nothing like seeing the light.Forand let's see. I'm just following my orders here.Staff, is there anybody I haven't spoken to?[] The President. No, I ain't calling on you. I'm calling onI said there were five questions. AnitaAnita from VOA.

Well, let me ask you aboutâ€”you've spent lots of time talking about all the time you spent with President Xi and the importance of leader-to-leader communication, yet you two haven't spoken in 10 months. And I just wonder, are you worried that this is destabilizing the U.S.-China relationship? And what are you going to do about it?And then, if I may, on Ukraine, sir. Kyiv is upsetâ€”[laughter]â€”is upset that the G-20 communique didn't name Russia as the aggressor.
